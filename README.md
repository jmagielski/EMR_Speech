# The clinical and genetic spectrum of paediatric speech and language disorders #

This repository consists of scripts that were used to analyze electronic medical record (EMR) data in pediatric speech and language disorders. Through the standardized phenotypic and genotypic analysis of the clinical data of individuals with these diagnoses, we explored the genotype-phenotype associations and characterized the clinical landscape.

## Scripts ##

[ICD10_code_analyses](https://github.com/jmagielski/EMR_Speech/blob/main/ICD10_code_analyses) - finds frequencies of different speech and language phenotypes over time, identifies comorbidities with speech disorders, and determines most common genetic diagnoses in the cohort.

[ICD10_code_genetic_dx](https://github.com/jmagielski/EMR_Speech/blob/main/ICD10_genetic_dx) - analyzes the associations between clinical genetic diagnoses and speech and language phenotypes reported in the ICD10 codes of the cohort.

[HPO_analysis](https://github.com/jmagielski/EMR_Speech/blob/main/HPO_analysis) - finds genotype-phenotype associations between variants from the whole-exome sequencing data and the speech and language disorder features captured from the clinical charts.

[EMR_visibility](https://github.com/jmagielski/EMR_Speech/blob/main/EMR_visibility) - assesses the relative presence of speech- and language-related diagnoses documented in the ICD10 codes versus in the clinical notes within the EMR.
